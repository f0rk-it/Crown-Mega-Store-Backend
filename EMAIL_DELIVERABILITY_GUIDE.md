    try:
        validate_email(email)
        return True
    except EmailNotValidError:
        return False
```

#### Bounce Handling
Implement bounce handling to remove invalid emails:
```python
# Track bounces and remove bad emails
def handle_bounce(email: str, bounce_type: str):
    if bounce_type == 'hard':
        # Remove from database
        pass
    elif bounce_type == 'soft':
        # Track soft bounces, remove after 5 attempts
        pass
```
